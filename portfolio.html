            <h3>Game Projects</h3>
            
            <h4>Spooky Street</h4>
            <p>Spooky Street is a mobile Halloween-themed arcade-style game I created in <b>Unity</b> and <b>C#</b> with 
                a dear friend of mine. I took on the lion's share of the programming, and I even made the art assets!
                <a href="https://www.errorloadingmedia.com/">Spooky Street</a> is available on the App Store and Google Play!</p>

            <h4>Round Town</h4>
            <p>This was my capstone project for my Bachelor's in Game Design &amp; Development at the University of Colorado 
                Colorado Springs. I created it using <b>C#</b> and I taught myself <b>Unity</b> and Blender in the process.</p>

            <h4>Games Reel</h4>
            <p>This reel is a compilation of short game projects and prototypes I have made, primarily during my time as a
                Game Development &amp; Design student. The majority of games shown were made using either Unity or GameMaker.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <h4>Used Furniture Inventory</h4>
            <p>Using <b>C#</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and the <b>Blazor</b> web framework, I collaborated with a backend
                developer to create a <a href="https://pfinventory.com/">website</a> where users could sort through available 
                inventory at our client's used furniture business as soon as it was scanned in at their warehouse.</p>

            <h3>Coding Projects</h3>
            <p>The following projects were made during my time at Coding Temple:</p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/jamesmbcarlson/CT_Project_02_Contacts">Contacts Management System</a></h4>
            <p>In <b>Python</b>, I created a CLI application that could add, modify, or delete contacts from a contacts list. I also included
                the functionality to export and import contacts from file.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/jamesmbcarlson/CT_Project_04_Library_Database">Library Management System</a></h4>
            <p>Using <b>Python</b> and <b>SQL</b>, I created a CLI library management application that could add in books, authors, and library users,
                and included the functionality to loan out and return books.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/jamesmbcarlson/CT_Project_05_Ecommerce_API">Ecommerce API Management</a></h4>
            <p>Using <b>Flask</b>, <b>SQLAlchemy</b>, and <b>Postman</b>, I created an app in <b>Python</b> that could create, read, update, and delete 
                customers, products, and the orders customers could place using the products.</p>
