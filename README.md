Project: Personal Portfolio Enhancement

Author: James Carlson

This project was built as an assignment for Coding Temple.


This HTML project is my portfolio built in HTML and CSS! It includes:
- A home page with a welcome message.
- An about me page with some personal details.
- A resume page made up of my skills, education, and work experience.
- A portfolio page displaying some of my coding projects.
- A contact page for getting in touch with me.

Please note, per assignment requirements, I did include the following:
- Use of the CSS transition property on the resume page (hover over the colored bars to the left of the headlines)
- Use of CSS animations (scroll down to the bottom of the portfolio page)


Thank you for reviewing my code and my portfolio website!
