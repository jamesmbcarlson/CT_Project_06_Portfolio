                    <p>I live in Denver, CO with my wife and our two pups, Wendell and Peaches. I grew up in Colorado, 
                        and am still delighted to call it home!</p>
                    <p>I studied Game Design and Development at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, and more 
                        recently attended Coding Temple, an online intensive coding school.</p>
                    <p>Professionally, I have worked in graphic design, videography, and hospitality. One of my greatest
                        passions is video game development, and I recently collaborated with a friend to develop and publish
                        our own mobile game.</p>
                    <p>Game development has instilled in me a love for programming, that I hope to turn into a new career. 
                        I look forward to building bigger and better games and other applications, as I become a more skilled
                        developer.</p>
                    <p>I value kindness, humor, integrity, and creative expression in work, and in all aspects of life. </p>

                <p">On a personal note, I am a multifaceted nerd who loves all kinds of games, from cozy indie games to frantic
                    first-person shooters. Likewise, I love quiet drama films, big-budget superhero movies, pulpy horror classics,
                    and everything in between. I love Dungeons &amp; Dragons, LEGO, pour over coffee, and a nice, juicy IPA!
